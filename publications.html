        This publication reports on a novel experimental protocol/system architecture for electrical impedance
        tomography based on the concept of Frequency-Division Multiplexing. A single continuous excitation that is the linear superposition of multiple sinewaves at different AC frequencies is set at all
        electrodes. Suppressing transient effects from contact impedance and reducing noise sensitivity of
        impedance estimates are the main benefits of the proposed method. A proof-of-concept experiment
        has been set up to illustrate the method with a simple four-electrode sensor.

        This publication reports on the development of a prototype electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
        sensor. The sensor features high frame acquisition rate, up to 6000 fps in classic adjacent mode,
        and up to 800 fps in the novel full scan mode. The repeatability of the experimental measurements
        is comparable with other reported high-speed EIT systems. A new calibration procedure based on
        the full scan measurements efficiently assess electrode-specific impedances caused by electrode misplacements or contact impedance. An analysis of the spectral behavior of impedance measurements
        highlight the influence of contact impedance at current-injection electrodes.

        This Ph.D. thesis manuscript reports on various aspects of the development of a prototype highspeed electrical impedance tomography sensor at CEA Cadarache. The R&D project is motivated
        by the need of reliable void fraction estimates of high temperature high pressure two-phase flows.

        This publication concerns the development of a methodology for flow regime identification using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). The sensor and the rig operated for generating a
        database of flow measurements are in University College of Southeast Norway. The originality of
        the method lies in the analysis of the raw signal of the ECT sensor, and a data fusion technique
        based on the eigenvalues of the capacitance matrix.

        This publication concerns the results of my M.Sc. thesis and neutronics simulations for nuclear
        reactors. The reactor pressure vessel (RPV) is the most critical component of the nuclear power
        plants regarding safety. Predicting aging of the RPV requires a source term: what is the flux and
        energy of neutrons at the RPV? In this publication, starting from reactor core calculation results
        and power history of a Swiss reactor, transport simulations with the probabilistic Monte-Carlo
        code MCNP have been performed. A methodology with weight-windows and source biasing has
        been defined to increase the computational efficiency of the numerical scheme.
