        This publication reports on a novel experimental protocol/system architecture for electrical impedance
        tomography based on the concept of Frequency-Division Multiplexing. A single continuous excitation that is the linear superposition of multiple sinewaves at different AC frequencies is set at all
        electrodes.

        This Ph.D. thesis manuscript reports on various aspects of the development of a prototype highspeed electrical impedance tomography sensor at CEA Cadarache. The R&D project is motivated
        by the need of reliable void fraction estimates of high temperature high pressure two-phase flows.

        This publication concerns the development of a methodology for flow regime identification using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT). The sensor and the rig operated for generating a
        database of flow measurements are in University College of Southeast Norway. The originality of
        the method lies in the analysis of the raw signal of the ECT sensor, and a data fusion technique
        based on the eigenvalues of the capacitance matrix.

        This publication concerns the computation of the neutron flux that reach the Reactor Pressure Vessel for predicting aging. Starting from reactor core calculation results
        and power history of a Swiss reactor, transport simulations with the probabilistic Monte-Carlo
        code MCNP have been performed. A methodology with weight-windows and source biasing has
        been defined to increase the computational efficiency of the numerical scheme.
