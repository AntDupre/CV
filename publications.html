        with reduced transients and noise sensitivity“, Sensors, Volume 18, Issue 4, 1013 (2018) [link]

        This publication reports on a novel experimental protocol/system architecture for electrical impedance
        tomography based on the concept of Frequency-Division Multiplexing. A single continuous excitation that is the linear superposition of multiple sinewaves at different AC frequencies is set at all
        electrodes. Suppressing transient effects from contact impedance and reducing noise sensitivity of
        impedance estimates are the main benefits of the proposed method. A proof-of-concept experiment
        has been set up to illustrate the method with a simple four-electrode sensor.
